# Experiment package for the memoized SPL static analysis

* 'builded_analyses' contains the compiled benchmark binaries that run both non-memoized and memoized versions of the analyses;
* 'source-code' holds code that orchestrate the execution of the benchmarks;
* `artifacts.tar.gz' contains the compressed subject 'vcfg' and list of changed functions for the subject revisions of the BusyBox SPL.

To run the experiments, extract the 'artifacts.tar.gz' file, go to the 'source-code' folder and read the instructions in the 'README.md' file.
